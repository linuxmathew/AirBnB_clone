# Project README

## Overview

Welcome to the **Data Management Console** project! This project provides a robust command-line interface (CLI) for creating, managing, and persisting objects. The console offers a powerful storage engine, enabling easy manipulation of objects without worrying about the underlying storage mechanisms.

## Features

- **Create Your Data Model**: Define and customize your data models to suit your application's needs.
- **Object Management**: Create, update, delete, and manage objects seamlessly through the console.
- **Persistent Storage**: Store and persist objects in a JSON file for consistent and reliable data management.
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interact with objects through the console, front-end, or REST API without concerning yourself with the details of data storage and persistence.
